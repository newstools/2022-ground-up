Join Bands Not Gangs is a community music school that aims to prevent children on the Cape Flats from falling into gangsterism by giving them music lessons. The school teaches guitar, drums, and piano. The programme also donates musical instruments to community leaders in gang-ridden areas.
GroundUp interviewed the founder of the programme, Karien De Waal, and music teacher Tommy Jooste in Scottsdene, Kraaifontein.
