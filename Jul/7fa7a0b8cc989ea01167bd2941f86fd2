Hundreds of Tshikota township residents marched to the Louis Trichardt Magistrates Court in Limpopo on Thursday protesting about the justice system, following the withdrawal of cases against two men.
The two men had been charged in at least four different cases between September 2021 and June 2022, including possession of unlicensed firearms, robbery and extortion.
GroundUp was told that one is still in police custody, while the other has been seen back in the community.
The protesters accuse the prosecutors and court officials of bungling the cases.
Community leader Adam Manari said residents had protested before about what they see as failures of the justice system. Last year they marched to the court.
In a memorandum, they called for a new magistrate to preside over the cases of the two men, and an independent investigation into the conduct of the court’s management and the state prosecutor.
Brighton Rarusunga said, “My family lives in fear of these criminals. Should I buy dogs to look after my family and my home? We are tired of these court officials.”
Thabang Masebe Tlou, secretary of the Tshikota SANCO branch, said that since the Tshikota Anti-Crime Group was established last year, criminal activities have been reduced. “This was through working with police but as matters are in court now, we are surprised cases are withdrawn,” he said.
Andries Matakala, acting court manager, signed the memo and promised residents that the cases would eventually be reinstated. He did not give reasons for the cases being withdrawn.
Limpopo National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi promised to send GroundUp’s questions on to the national office. Their response will be included once received.
