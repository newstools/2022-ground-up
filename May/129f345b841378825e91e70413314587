The bridge in January after it collapsed.
There was jubilation, ululations, chanting and clapping in Maqwathini Village on 14 April when the Eastern Cape Department of Transport sent Qush Plant Hire to repair, reconstruct and rebuild a R220,000 bridge that was swept away by heavy rains in December.
Qush had not finished constructing the bridge in Maqwathini, Lupapasi, when it closed for the December holidays. Then the rains struck.
Two months ago we wrote how the community, desperately in need of a bridge to reach schools, clinics and the town, were demanding a proper bridge be built.
Headman Gungqa applauded the people, government officials and the contractor for speeding up the process of reconstructing the bridge.
Alfred Klaas a taxi owner and operator said he was glad as using the bridge would save time and cut petrol costs.
The Eastern Cape Department of Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose said “the contractor went to fix it at no extra cost”.
